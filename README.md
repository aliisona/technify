# technify

welcome to technify! a social media made by teens FOR teens! we strive to close the gap in underrepresented groups in tech by providing a free-to-use app that incorporates users posting and sharing their cs discoveries! 

although this is only iteration and an extreme alpha of this app, we are excited to continue working on this project for the future, and create a safe space for everyone to be exposed to tech, no matter your income, gender, race, or religious beliefs!

the e in tech is for everyone ;)
